# PDEA-Encryption

## How To Execute
To run the algorithm from the terminal you would run it like "*C:>Encryption.exe **Password Encrypting Security File***"
- **Password**: the password to encrypt/decrypt with
- **Encrypting**: either true/false true for encrypting, false for decrypting
- **Security**: a number in the range 1 -> 8. this is the security level you want to encrypt/decrypt with. this must be the same for encrypting and decrypting a file to work correctly
- **File**: Link to the un-encrypted file. if your decrypting just enter the filename without .pdea
